	<div id="featurette">
		When I was in treatment, I thought I held all of the keys to a full recovery. The day I left, I realized I had just begun to grow and knew little of the healing potential within the recovery process. Every issue caused me turmoil, and old resentments, frustration, and self-pity threatened my recovery. I spent many anguished days searching for help.<br><br>
		With my own struggle in mind, my heart was led to create the Gables, a secure environment in which to experience this awesome new process of growth. If you feel a need for more guided help in attaining hope and truly living a life of recovery, my staff and I would welcome you at the Gables.<br><br>
		We're here to help.<br>

	<span style="color: #39399b; font-weight: bold;">The Gables is pleased to announce recent changes to our recovery services!</span><br><br>
	The Gables has offered extended treatment to women for 23 years. We are no longer just an extended treatment program. The Gables is now a treatment Center for women, offering the traditional Minnesota Model primary residential treatment along with extended, halfway house, day outpatient primary treatment, and hourly outpatient chemical dependency treatment services. This allows the women to continue their care with the providers and support systems that they have established.
