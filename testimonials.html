<p>I am so blessed to have been in the Gables program. I would personally like to thank all of the staff and their hard work and support. Whether I had a  chance to get to know you or not during my stay at the Gables. I appreciate each and every one of you, your dedication and commitment has changed not only my life, but the lives of many women who have passed through your doors. Thank you all for everything that you do!</p>
<p>I hope to stay connected with the Gables so I may continue to give back what was so freely given to me. I have listed my contact information below.</p>
<p>I feel truly blessed at being given a second chance at life. I have struggled through numerous treatment centers for drugs and alcohol before I found my way to The Gables. Their comprehensive and structured program was exactly what I needed in order to begin my new life. I am grateful for dedicated and knowledgeable staff, and having the support of my peers, to help me step by step through this transformation. Not only did I learn how to overcome my active addiction, this program has taught me a lot about myself, I truly learned how to live! My relationships with family members have been restored, I am working, taking college classes and an active member in the recovery programs in my community. I learned to have the courage and strength to work hard and never give up on myself.</p>
<p>I am so thankful today for the faith, hope and happiness in my life today. I can only hope that other women out there suffering can find the strength and willingness to experience a better way to live. The Gables was the beginning of a new path in my life “I now know a new freedom I never experienced before.”</p>
<p>With Many Thanks,  Becca</p><br />

<p>My name is Emily I’m 21 years old and I am an addict. I have been struggling with my addiction since I was 13 years old. I have been trying to get sober for the last 4 years, in and out of treatment centers.</p>
<p>When I entered Detox I had no hope, I was a lost cause. I stayed there for a week. Then I went to a 45 day program before I went to the Gables.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the most pleasant person when I arrived at the Gables. It was very structured with a lot of rules which I was not used to. Eventually, I finally realized that the Gables was exactly what I needed and I stopped resisting. I finally put my hands up and let someone else take the wheel. This experience has taught me so much and has changed my life in so many ways. It has made me grow into a better person in just three months.</p>
<p>I have learned so much from my counselors and peers. They have watched me cry and they have watched me grow. They have been a big part of my recovery, supportive; loving; caring.</p>
<p>My journey here has given me the tools to cope with life and its hard times.</p>
<p>It has made me stronger, it made me wiser. I leave here with a whole different attitude and outlook on life. But most of all, here at the Gables I have finally found who I am and I’ve learned how to love myself, for this I am thankful for the Gables.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Emily
